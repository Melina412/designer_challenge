                Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
                could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
                wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
                some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
                thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made
                a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem
                was that the result was just something nice and did not solve
                any problem.

                    feedback and learn from it.
